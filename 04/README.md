#Experiment Description

This experiment follows the design philosophy of Cleveland and McGill's experiment in 1984. Here we have four chart types in total. They are bar chart, pie chart, bubble chart and radial bar chart, representing aligned length, angle, area and aligned length on radial axis respectively. 

The hypothesis we have for the experiment is two-fold.

 1. A numbered list
  1. A nested numbered list
  2. Which is numbered
 2. Which is numbered

 Markup : 1. Aligned length has the best performance, followed by 		  angle then area.
		  2. Radial axis leads to misunderstanding, and aligned length on radial axis will have much worse performance than aligned length on rectilinear axis.

#Technical Achievements

###Latin Square Design. 
In our experiment there are four chart types, thus a corresponding latin square would be 4X4 in size. The algorithm to randomly generate this latin square contains 3 stages. 

- Stage 1: Generate the first row. Four elements of this row each contains a unique chart type, that is to say, distribute all chart types in this row.

- Stage 2: Proliferate other rows. Generate other rows to compelete the latin square. There are two ways to get there, namely cyclically right shift elements of first row to obtain a forward diagonal square, or cyclically left shift to obtain a reverse diagonal one.

For a forward diagonal latin square, e.g. 

Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 | Cell 4
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
1      | 2      | 3      | 4
4      | 1      | 2      | 3
3      | 4      | 1      | 2
2      | 3      | 4      | 1

Number represents chart types.
Notice first cell of each row is the same as the last cell of last row. If we flatten the square and generate charts accordingly, we'll have adjacent charts every two other charts. It violates the intention of "evenly distribute all charts to reduce variance".

Thus we go for reverse diagonal latin square, e.g.

Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 | Cell 4
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
1      | 2      | 3      | 4
2      | 3      | 4      | 1
3      | 4      | 1      | 2
4      | 1      | 2      | 3

- Stage 3: Flatten the square and generate charts accordingly.

- Stage 4: Apply the square to entire experiment. For the 80 trials per participant, simply repeat the procedure 5 times.

#Design Achievements

###Switchable adjacent markers 

- We have implemented a switch to toggle on/off the policy of no adjacent markers. Checking the "Adjacent" box in the first page will make all charts to only generate adjacent markers. Therefore we can test out adjacency versus no adjacency on the same type of chart.

###Switchable fill color 

- Similiarly, we have also implemented a switch to toggle on/off the policy of no color. Checking the "Color" box in the first page will make all charts to fill the marked values with two random colors. Thus we can test out what colors can do to human's perception of the two values.

###Very unfortunately, no one was willing to conduct a survey containing 80 pages 4 or 3 or even 2 times. We decided to put in these features but follow only the vanilla experiment, for now.

###d3's ~~pesky~~ packed layout

-The packed layout of d3 changes the ratio of input data, making radii of all bubbles closer to each other than they actually are. There's no official way to preserve the ratio as far as we're concerned. Therefore in order to keep the input data in the same format with other input charts, I manually scaled the auto-generated node data, altering their "r" value. This nullifies the "padding" attribute of the layout, so if you see(very rarely though) a bubble chart with some edges clipping each other, shame on ... him.

-Also packed layout will sometimes change the order of the random values to "pack" the bubbles, making my adjacent only design look like a joke. Duh.
