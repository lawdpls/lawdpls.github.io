#Teammates

- Huayan Sun(jacysun)

- Shijian Li(lawdpls)

#Description

In this experiment, we have four chart types in total. 

#Technical Achievements

###Latin Square Design. 
In our experiment there are four chart types, thus a corresponding latin square would be 4X4 in size. The algorithm to randomly generate this latin square contains 3 stages. 
Stage 1: Generate the first row.

#Design Achievements

- The packed layout of d3 changes the ratio of input data, making radii of all bubbles closer to each other than they actually are. Therefore in order to keep the input data in the same range and fashion with other input charts, I manually altered the node data.
