<p> <font color="blue"><b>Ph.D. students:</b></font> I am always looking for creative, self-motivated and hardworking graduate students who want to pursue a PhD degree by working with me on networked systems, systems security, online privacy, and measurement. Solid background of computer science, with strength in system building, data analysis, and usable theory are required. If interested in joining our group, please do the following. 1) Read 2-3 papers of my recent publications (from the past 2 years) to make sure that you are interested in what we do. 2) Apply to our Ph.D. program, 3) send me a brief summary of your background and a CV (PDF or txt files only!), a summary of the 2-3 papers you read, and what you liked about them. In the title of your first email, put “<font color="red">Potential Ph.D. student</font>” to know that you have read this note. I don't admit Ph.D. student by myself, and you should direct all questions concerning admission to the graduate admission committee. However, all students admitted and accepted to work in my group will be funded in a form or another for 5 years to do their Ph.D. More frequently asked questions:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Are those Ph.D. positions guaranteed funding?</b> Yes, for 5 years. 
      <li> <b>I don't have GRE and TOEFL scores. Can I still apply?</b> No. First have them, then apply.
        <li><b>How can I apply?</b> <a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/admissions/graduate/">follow this link</a>
          <li><b>What are the cut-off GRE and TOEFL scores?</b> I don't know. Check the link above for any answers (and perhaps let me know)
          <li><b>I am from country X, can I still apply?</b> I would think so. If you can get a visa to the US, you can certainly apply. 
          <li><b>How long does it take to finish a Ph.D.?</b> Typically 5 years (varies from a student to another)
            <li><b>Can you tell me my chances of getting admitted by looking at my C.V.?</b> No. Admission is not decided by me, and it's a complex time-dependent process.
              <li><b>Can you tell me how it's like to work with you?</b> I can, but it's better to ask my students and research associates. Email any of them in confidence with questions. 
                <li><b>How long should students spend on their research (in your group)?</b> Enough to get the work done 48 hours before any deadline. 
                  <li><b>Would it be possible to work with you on project X (something you worked on 7 years ago)?</b> Likely no!
                    <li><b>Can we talk? I am a student at UB</b> Yes. Follow the instructions above.
                      <li><b>Can we talk? I am a student from country X.</b> Yes. Follow the instructions above first, though. 
                          


  </ul>

<p> <font color="blue"><b>M.Sc. students:</b></font> I have research projects for M.Sc. thesis students. If you are a self-motivated and hardworking student at UB and would like to work on a cool research project in the above areas, consider taking CSE664 and/or CSE709, offered in the Spring and Fall, if you did not do that already, and send me an email to find a time to talk. NOTE: students are expected to spend no less than 15 hours per week on their research as part of this position. 

<p> <font color="blue"><b>Undergraduate students:</b></font> Undergraduate students interested in working in our group should first consider taking introduction to computer security (offered in the Fall of 2016 as CSE410-special topics). Students with solid computer science background and skills (i.e., programming, algorithms, analysis, hacking, and curiosity) should contact me to setup a time to discuss potential projects.

<p> <font color="blue"><b>Interns:</b></font>  As of 01/2016, I cannot host interns (without any exceptions).

<p> <font color="blue"><b>Postdocs:</b></font>  As of 01/2016, I am not looking for postdocs.

<p> <font color="blue"><b>Visitors:</b></font>  I occasionally have the space and time to host fully funded research visitors. Area-wise, I am interested in hosting visitors who can complement our areas of interest, including networked systems, data-driven security, applied cryptography, online privacy, and online profiling. A major theme that we seek collaboration on is big data security, utilizing machine learning, AI, data mining, etc., and addressing representation, processing and analysis, and decision-making, mainly for security applications. If you are interested, email me to discuss such opportunities.
