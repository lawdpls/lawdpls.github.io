# Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3

[Link to the submission](http://lawdpls.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html).

For this assignment I created a tribute to the supreme leader Kim Jong Un. The idea is simple, to capture his splendor and grandeur with the simple shapes and colors required in the assignment.

Naturally, using an 8-bit artstyle is a great solution to implement this. So his torso and limbs, along with accessories like sunglasses and buttons are all presented with rectangles.

Since we have the requirement of using polygons, I decided to [shape his head with polygons instead of rectangles](http://lawdpls.github.io/01-ghd3/pic1.png). Thus the majority of his hair is also a polygon. The hair is completed with two circles to recreate Kim's impressive hairstyle.

Speaking of circles, his hands are also little circles. Using smooth edges like circles violates the coarseness essence of 8-bit art, but to fulfill the requirement I have to adopt it and keep the impact as low as possible. Therefore I didn't use a lot of circles.

As for lines, I have one line in the whole picture, which is the frame of Kim's sunglasses. Simple lines are not great in 2D art so I kept them minimal just to meet the requirement.

Last but not least, I wanted to give soul to this submission. Kim Jong Un could never be fleshed out without a kick of tyranny and imbecility. Using what we learned in class of animation and interaction, I tried to capture the edginess of our supreme leader with . And I hope I've done it right.
